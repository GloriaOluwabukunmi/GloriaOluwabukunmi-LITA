- Average Age: Average age for the total number of Empployee was gotten with the DAX (Data Analysis Expression) FUNCTION called MEASURES.
  ### How the Data was used
- Importing and Transforming the Excel file provided by the company into Powerbi. This is the firat and a very important steps when analysing data with powerbi. The transform stge was where the data will be cleaned properly inorder to give accurate result while visualizing and analysing.The consistency of the column was checked i.e the column quality, column profile and column distribution.
